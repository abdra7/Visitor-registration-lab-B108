# Lab 108 - Computer Lab Student Attendance Management System

## Project Introduction

This project aims to develop a simple and efficient web-based system dedicated to managing student attendance in the computer lab (Lab 108) at the Technical College. The system allows administrators to record each student’s name, academic number, and the exact times of their check-in and check-out, ensuring an organized and reliable tracking process.

The system defines two types of users:  
- **Super Admin:** Has full control over the system, including the ability to create, edit, and delete normal Admin accounts, in addition to managing student attendance.  
- **Normal Admin:** Is restricted to managing student attendance only, without any access to admin account settings.

The design focuses on providing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, utilizing **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** technologies. The branding and logo of the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC) are incorporated into the design to align with the identity and standards of the Technical College.

By implementing this system, the management of the computer lab will become more organized, secure, and efficient. The system also supports the broader digital transformation initiatives pursued by educational institutions, promoting modern and automated solutions for administrative tasks.
